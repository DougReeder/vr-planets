# vr-planets

This project is a simple simulation of a planetary system in virtual reality for
use with the Oculus Quest, Rift, or Rift S (or any device compatible with the
`oculus-touch-controls` A-Frame component). The user can create a new planet by
pressing the `a` button. If the `a` button is held, then the user can drag their
right hand through space to set the initial velocity of the newly created
planet.

Currently the planet motion is simulated using the Eulerian method.
